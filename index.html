            <p> My name is Dave Brooke. I am from Statesville, North Carolina. I have 5 kids and work as an IT Project Manager for a Web Development company. I recently obtained this job, and it is the first time I have worked in the web development space.
                Previously, I was the IT Director for Cook Out restaurants and then transitioned to IT Director of a local school to spend more time with the family. I returned to school to do my job better, understand what the developers are talking about, and manage the projects more efficiently. I want to add more value to the company and move up.
                I enjoy playing Minecraft and camping with my children, woodworking, reading high-fantasy books, and spending time with my beautiful wife.
                I am very comfortable collaborating and am excited to get to know everyone!</p>
